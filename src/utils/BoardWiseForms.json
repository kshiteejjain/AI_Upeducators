Matches and sorts common 2D shapes by features and size. Matches common 3D objects to corresponding shapes and classifies them based on observable features. Recognizes 'circle' and 'square' and establishes correspondence with everyday objects. Recognizes 'rectangle' and 'triangle' and establishes correspondence with everyday objects. Matches and sorts concrete objects and pictures based on visual attributes like shape, size, and colour. Applies own rule(s) to sort groups of objects. Describes the physical features of various solids /shapes in her own language. Classifies objects into groups based on a few physical attributes such as shape, size, and other observable properties including rolling and sliding recites number names, and counts objects up to 20, concretely, pictorially, and symbolically." },

Uses number count is independent of object arrangement (number conservation). Identifies and writes numbers (1-9). Matches object with correct numbers (1-9) and create groups corresponding to a given number (concrete, pictorial). Determines if one group has more / less/ same items as the other. Creates groups with equal number of items (1- 9) (Numerically and pictorially). Completes number sequences by counting forward and backward (1-9). Sequences up to three numbers (1-9) in increasing or decreasing order (concrete and pictorial). Develops concept of zero and its symbol.
