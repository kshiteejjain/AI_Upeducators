List the animal products in order to understand how we depend on them for our food. Categorize organisms into herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores based on their food habits or nutrition. Identifies materials and organisms, such as plant fibers and flowers, on the basis of observable features, i.e., appearance, and texture, Identify the sources of ingredients which are used to function, aroma, etc. Makes efforts to protect environment, e.g., minimising wastage of food, water, electricity and generation of waste; spreading awareness to adopt rain water harvesting; care for plants, etc. Classifies materials, organisms and processes based on observable properties, e.g., materials as soluble, insoluble, transparent, translucent and opaque; changes that can be reversed and cannot be reversed; plants as herbs, shrubs, trees, creeper, climbers; components of habitat as biotic and abiotic; motion as rectilinear, circular, periodic etc." },
